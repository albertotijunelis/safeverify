## 1.1.3 — 2026-03-12

### ML Training & Classification
- Trained binary classification model (Random Forest, 12,728 samples, 63 features): 99.18% accuracy, F1 99.32%, ROC AUC 99.97%.
- Trained family classification model (Random Forest, 68 classes): 98.65% accuracy, F1 98.50%, ROC AUC 99.99%.
- Real-time classification active: every analyzed file gets an ML prediction injected into results.

### Dataset & Ingest
- Batch ingest of 12,728 samples (7,752 malicious from MalwareBazaar + 4,976 benign system files).
- Feature extractor now accepts `mb_metadata` for ground-truth labels from MalwareBazaar.
- Threat-intel features derived from MalwareBazaar metadata during ingest.
- Benign ingest uses `os.walk` recursion across SysWOW64 + Program Files directories.

### Security
- HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification on serialized ML models (save and load).
- `.gitignore` hardened: `*.db`, `*.sqlite*`, `*.joblib`, `*.pkl`, `*.hmac`, `models/` excluded from version control.
- Database and model files confirmed never pushed to GitHub.

### Web Dashboard
- IOC listing rewritten: expandable detail lists for 9 IOC categories (URLs, IPs, domains, emails, crypto wallets, PowerShell commands, suspicious paths, user agents, registry keys).
- Each IOC item has a copy-to-clipboard button with hover reveal.
- Color-coded IOC categories with count badges.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed IOC graph not showing IOC nodes: `build_graph()` now handles flat `to_dict()` structure with fallback, and uses correct `ips` key instead of `ip_addresses`.
- Added benign source option to dashboard ingest dropdown.

### Testing & Quality
- 1,212 tests passing, 93% coverage (6,247 statements, 468 missed).
- Updated batch ingest test mocks from `_analyse_file` to `_analyse_file_batch`.

- Dynamic limit field adapts max value per source (100/1,000/10,000).
- Immediate visual feedback with spinner and "Fetching candidates..." message while background fetch runs.
- Fixed Start Ingest button alignment in the batch ingest form.

### Bug Fixes
- Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` and `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()` calls with timezone-aware alternatives (`ioc_enrichment.py`, `pe_analyzer.py`).
